## 🧐 Problem Statement <a name = "problem_statement"></a>

Hiking is one of the most healthy activities out there. Going out for a hike is a fun way to spend the weekend, especially if there's good weather. However, it may be difficult for beginners to find treks or paths that are easy enough to tackle. For expert hikers, they would want to find more and more similar or harder treks.
It is also important to know that a given route is within your abilities as the person may not have the skills, equipment and confidence to tackle harder trails. This makes it a safety issue as well.

## 💡 Idea / Solution <a name = "idea"></a>

Our idea is to help hikers figure out their next trek by -

- TTC - Time to complete the trek
- Classification - Ranking a trek based on difficulty
- Recommendation - Suggest similar routes based on requirement or difficulty levels

## ⛓️ Dependencies / Limitations <a name = "limitations"></a>

- What are the dependencies of your project?
- Describe each limitation in detailed but concise terms
- Explain why each limitation exists
- Provide the reasons why each limitation could not be overcome using the method(s) chosen to acquire.
- Assess the impact of each limitation in relation to the overall findings and conclusions of your project, and if
  appropriate, describe how these limitations could point to the need for further research.

## 🚀 Future Scope <a name = "future_scope"></a>

Write about what you could not develop during the course of the Hackathon; and about what your project can achieve
in the future.

## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development
and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

## 🎈 Usage <a name="usage"></a>

Add notes about how to use the system.
