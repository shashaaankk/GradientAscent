## 🧐 Problem Statement <a name = "problem_statement"></a>

Hiking is one of the most healthy activities out there. Going out for a hike is a fun way to spend the weekend, especially if there's good weather. However, it may be difficult for beginners to find treks or paths that are easy enough to tackle. For expert hikers, they would want to find more and more similar or harder treks.
It is also important to know that a given route is within your abilities as the person may not have the skills, equipment and confidence to tackle harder trails. This makes it a safety issue as well.

## 💡 Idea / Solution <a name = "idea"></a>

Our idea is to help hikers figure out their next trek by -

- TTC - Time to complete the trek
- Classification - Ranking a trek based on difficulty
- Recommendation - Suggest similar routes based on requirement or difficulty levels

## 🚀 Future Scope <a name = "future_scope"></a>

Context-aware Predictions

- Add weather data, trail conditions, or seasonal patterns to refine difficulty and time predictions.
- Include factors like snow cover, mud, or trail closures.
